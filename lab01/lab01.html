        <p>
            Something <span class="p">personal</span> is that I have a demonic dog named Gizmo. He hates men but loves my family. <span class="p">Professionally</span>, I used to intern with radio perosnality Maxwell Jones at iHeart Radio. And something <span class="p">peculiar </span>is that I just got home from Japan and moved in to a new apartment on the first day of my last semester of college!
