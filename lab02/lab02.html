        <h1>Maddy de Vera</h1>

            <p>
                Something <strong class="p">personal</strong> is that I have a demonic dog named Gizmo. He hates men but loves my family. <strong class="p">Professionally</strong>, I used to intern with radio perosnality Maxwell Jones at iHeart Radio. And something <strong class="p">peculiar </strong>is that I just got home from Japan and moved in to a new apartment on the first day of my last semester of college!
